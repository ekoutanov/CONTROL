Chapter 5. Process Model
---
**CONTROL builds around Principal Engineers**. They are assumed to be among the most experienced, mature and skilled engineers in the delivery organisation. Everyone else either supports PEs or acts at their direction.

Delivery in CONTROL is concurrent across unrelated product _capabilities_, initiated by the Product and Architecture teams, acting as internal stakeholders in the delivery organisation. Each capability is delivered in one or more successive _stages_. A stage is led by a Principal Engineer (PE) and comprises a loose sequence of distinct _phases_. The completion of a stage results in a _logically complete capability increment_. The diagram below illustrates the delivery process.

The CONTROL process model shares many structural elements with other methods from both the Classical and Agile schools. We urge the reader to pay careful attention as many of the resemblances are superficial and the devil is, as usual, in the details.

_The Control Process Model._

# Delivery phases
## Ideation
The architecture and product teams join forces to explore and conceptualise capabilities well ahead of planned delivery. This gives both parties a long(er) planning horizon and time for analysis without necessarily committing to concrete deliverables.

+ The Product Owner (PO) will initially consult with the business, organise focus groups, study the competitive landscape.
+ The PO will assemble rough mock-ups, user journeys, performance criteria, and other high-level artifacts.
+ Important questions are answered —
  - "what problem are we solving?"
  - "what value does it produce?"
  - "when does the business need this by?"
  - "is this even feasible?"
+ Depending on the capability, a rough definition of a Minimal Viable Product (MVP) may be drawn up, acting as a guide for scoping the next phase.
+ Architecture produces a conceptual architecture view that satisfies the requirements while aligning with the broader architectural strategy. 
+ The main aphorism of this phase is "no surprises!"

The Ideation phase is optional and may occur out-of-cycle; it does not act as a hard dependency for subsequent phases. CONTROL strongly encourages that a product capability undergoes Ideation at least once during its delivery life cycle. Ideation helps not only the strategists in the delivery organisation but also the business in obtaining early feedback on the viability of a product capability. It's a reality check of sorts.

![Ideation phase](images/diagrams-ideation.png)

_The Ideation phase._

## Abstraction
Prior to entering delivery, the nominated PO firms up an _abstract_ requirements specification, including nonfunctional concerns, which are ultimately signed off by the business.

+ For complex capabilities, delivery is subdivided into stages. 
+ Each stage is _abstractly_ specified: all critical aspects of the capability are stated with sufficient rigour without overspecifying the trivialities. 
  - By "critical", it is meant either "hard to change" or "impactful", depending on the industry.
  - Essential context is preserved so that subsequent decision-makers benefit from a more holistic understanding of the problem.
+ POs may not know which aspects of the system are hard to change. The Architects consult POs on aspects of the requirements that must be specified rigorously and point out those that may be relaxed.
+ Architects may advise on stage scope, using their knowledge of the system to estimate roughly how long things might take to build and which teams will be involved. 
  - Stage scope represents a logically complete capability iteration. Stages are not time-boxed.
+ Critical stage requirements are locked-in before the build commences. This is done by having the business stakeholders sign off on the requirements.
+ Delivery phases may be pipelined. The Ideation or Elaboration phases for the next stage may begin before the current stage is fully delivered.
+ This phase guarantees specification stability without overspecifying constraints, allowing for comfortable planning.
+ Architects may use this phase to produce conceptual designs if they weren't done earlier.

The Abstraction phase is among the chief risk mitigation activities in CONTROL. It creates a _stable set of assumptions_ around risky aspects of the specification that are carry significant implications or are difficult or costly to change, while preserving the relevant problem context. Foolproof models don't exist. We cannot entirely avoid mistakes in analysis, but we can do much to mitigate the consequences by prioritising the riskiest areas.

CONTROL expands upon Boehm's original proposition (1988): "The project team must decide how much detail is enough". It does so with a carefully laid-out process and specific personal accountability. Architects are ideally suited to marshal abstraction and risk-reduction activities at the requirements level, as they practice similar activities routinely in their architectural analysis. To experienced architects, abstraction is their bread and risk-reduction is their butter.

Upon completing Abstraction, the Architect and the PO are presumed to be satisfied with the substance and the level of detail in the requirements specification. The end of Abstraction acts as the transition point between strategic and tactical leadership; the abstract requirements constitute both the problem and the context that are being passed on. 

![Abstraction phase](images/diagrams-abstraction.png)

_The Abstraction phase._

## Elaboration
One PE is chosen from a pool of available PEs to lead the delivery. They're in charge from here on. Strategic leadership maintains presence as internal stakeholders; PEs must ensure that designs are compliant with architectural principles.

+ PEs may work concurrently on capabilities if capacity permits. In practice, one PE might look after one large capability and maybe two smaller ones. Personal capacity management is left to their discretion — we trust our PEs.
+ There may be reasons why a PE cannot take on a new capability. Perhaps they are working on other product or technical capabilities. (The latter is another term for addressing technical debt.)
+ The PE pool and its capacity constraints act as a natural limiter of work in progress. Engineering cannot deliver more (large-ish) capabilities concurrently than they have PEs. (Bugfixes and minor enhancements take an alternate path.) We remark on capacity issues later in this chapter.

The PE refines an earlier conceptual design, if one exists, collaborating with Architecture, POs and the impacted EMs. Alternatively, the PE produces a fresh design.

Designs produced by EMs are sufficiently detailed to remove material risks, but needn't unduly constrain the implementation. For example, they may intentionally underspecify many component-level decisions, except those deemed architecturally-significant. PEs strive to preserve the context of the original problem, while leaving ample room for further design refinements to be introduced by members of the delivery squad. Creativity is not just the realm of Architects and PEs.

At this point, NFRs relating to the end-to-end solution must be decomposed to the level of individual components. This ensures that Engineering teams are able to independently assure the nonfunctional characteristics of their parts of the system.

+ Sometimes Architects will have designed the capability at a conceptual level before it is due to enter delivery, which may make things easier at this juncture.
+ Architects sign off on the elaborated design, comprising:
  - a catalogue of new and impacted components, including relevant details of the changes
  - various architectural views representing the static and dynamic properties of the system
  - system invariants
  - detailed algorithms and (semi-)formal specifications (if and where applicable)
  - component-level NFRs
+ Architects review the delivery plan, comprising:
  - the affected teams
  - sequences of deliverables
  - high-level work breakdown
  - high-level estimates
+ In high-risk systems, the PE may additionally produce proof-of-concept type software, simulations, etc. The Elaboration phase may take longer, but it will significantly reduce the risk of failure down the line.

It is a common misconception that architects, and only architects, should occupy their time drawing boxes and arrows. (Perhaps to keep them away from producing second rate code?) In CONTROL, Architects are mainly accountable for the alignment of the system architecture with long-term business objectives. (Sounds ostentatious but someone has got to do it.) A diagram is a tool that assists in communication, nothing more, nothing less. Anyone can do it, and everyone should do it! In a conventional world, architects hand over design artifacts to engineers and pray that they have been read, let alone interpreted correctly. On the receiving end, engineers will often nod and carry on building what suits them.

In the Elaboration phase, the PEs are largely responsible for solution design, so they've got to master communication. This means wielding all sorts of tools to help them model the problem and convince themselves and others that their solutions are optimal or at least viable. Their design will not be exhaustive; it will be further elaborated by the delivery squad in the course of implementing the solution. 

It must be stressed that _Architects are not solely responsible for producing solution designs_. Everyone is encouraged to design. Architects are accountable for the strategic suitability of those designs that end up getting delivered.

Complex capabilities delivered over several stages may undergo a change in delivery leadership. The PE leading the previous stage may be unavailable for any number of reasons. Because each stage is logically complete, stages may be treated independently.

![Elaboration phase](images/diagrams-elaboration.png)

_The Elaboration phase._

## Formation
During the Formation phase, PEs work with EMs to assemble a delivery squad from members of impacted teams, to ultimately furnish the capability end to end. 

+ Team members are recruited into a temporary group based on the unique needs of the delivery.
+ Skills are stipulated by the PE, with consultation from the EMs.
+ The context is fully imparted onto the delivery squad by PE. 
+ Estimates are refined with the aid of squad Engineers.
+ Seconded squad members do not leave the larger team; they maintain the EM reporting line.
+ A Project Coordinator may assist in facilitating estimation activities and documenting outcomes.

The preservation of context is a central theme within CONTROL, made possible by the delivery squad model. Those involved in delivery understand the broader problem as well as the comparably smaller piece(s) they have been entrusted with. Furthermore, the strong conceptual integrity of the solution is made possible by the sole delivery lead who also happens to be the most senior and experienced person on the delivery team.

The Formation phase should be a relatively quick one. The impacted teams and the skills needed for delivery should be gauged midway through Elaboration, and _provided engineering capacity exists_, Formation needn't wait for Elaboration to complete, provided that the most risky items have been considered and elaborated. To that extent, Formation can be attacked in parallel with Elaboration.

The capacity of PEs is distinct from that of the engineering teams, however. Independently of delivery activities, EMs will ensure that some capacity is reserved to deal with software maintenance and support. As a result, there may not be enough free engineers available to tackle the new capability. While it's possible to earmark people and onboard them in advance for future work, CONTROL strongly advises against this. A crucial part of Formation is to propagate context, which shouldn't be allowed to go stale. Formation should thus immediately precede Construction.

The refined estimates produced during the Formation phase will either crystalise stakeholder expectations or spark a negotiation process around scope. Either will go a long way towards protecting the delivery team from unreasonable deadlines and the business from surprises. As Kent Beck said masterfully in _XP Explained_ (1999), "It's not my job to 'manage' someone else's expectations. It's their job to manage their own expectations. It's my job to do my best and to communicate clearly."

With the benefit of the delivery squad model, CONTROL attacks the biggest source of unpredictability in Agile — estimation. When we say, for example, that a ticket is a five-pointer, we have no clue what that mean in practice. Agile estimation assumes that some abstract developer will work on the ticket in question because we have no knowledge who that developer will be. People cannot be abstracted this way, and there is no "average" developer. It's not even a matter of skill: people who are familiar with certain tasks will accomplish them quicker. In a delivery squad model, we can often tell exactly who that developer will be. Even in large delivery squads, only a few people will work on any given component. So, not only can we estimate with _a priori_ knowledge of these people, but it is them who will produce the estimates in the Formation phase. As a member of a delivery squad you are almost always estimating on your behalf.

![Formation phase](images/diagrams-formation.png)

_The Formation phase._

## Construction
During the Construction phase, the PE maintains a lead role in building the capability and ensuring its conformance to stakeholder expectations. 

+ Their main responsibility is end-to-end delivery, with emphasis on engineering quality. This requires both functional and nonfunctional testing plans to be established.
+ PEs may choose to remain on the tools, and they typically will do so for foundational/ground-laying work.
  - PEs are not necessarily the only senior members on the delivery squad; they may delegate this work.
  - PEs shouldn't count towards the capacity of the squad. A PE's job is, first and foremost, to solve problems and provide guidance. In this regard, programming is a means to an end, but not the only means.
  - Involvement of PEs is a risk-mitigation exercise: assessing technical risks early and assigning the most consequential risks to the most capable people. 
+ The maintenance of components is the responsibility of the larger team, so peer reviews and knowledge sharing are essential.
+ The PE acts as the main liaison between stakeholders and the delivery squad. 
  - Any anomalies in the delivery are communicated by the PE.
  - A Project Coordinator may support and assist the PE in delivery management, and take on the responsibility for communications.
  - Basic project management or coordination skills are highly useful in this role, regardless of the Project Coordinator's involvement.

The Construction phase continues until the capability meets its functional and nonfunctional requirements.

One cannot reasonably expect that the highest level of care and commitment be accorded if there is a high likelihood that engineers will be reassigned to different teams. Accountability cannot exist without authority, and the prospect of relinquishing control, even in some indeterminate future, is enough to erode that commitment. There is little upside or downside in exercising care if software will be passed like a relay baton. Likewise, software components owned by two or more teams might as well be owned by neither. For that reason, the integrity and constitution of engineering teams is the cornerstone of sustainable systems engineering. 

CONTROL maintains long-term affinity between members and their teams, and insists that each software component is owned by exactly one team for life. The delivery squad is orthogonal to the long-lived engineering team structure; the two constructs intersect in scope. Squad members exclusively work on components belonging to their engineering teams. They can and should engage fellow teammates outside the squad to review their code, as ownership ultimately rests with the team.

![Construction phase](images/diagrams-construction.png)

_The Construction phase._

## Out-of-cycle verification
CONTROL does not define a formal verification phase within the process model, despite having well-defined roles for the System Tester and the System Testing Manager. (Roles are defined in Chapter 6.) Verification can take place at any time that is convenient for the System Testing team to perform this activity. This may seem overly relaxed, especially compared to the rigid verification processes associated with plan-driven methods. There is little doubt that independent verification is required when a system reaches a certain level of complexity, but the timing of the activity may depend on the type of capability being delivered and resource constraints:

* If the stakeholders in the capability delivery require verification prior to acceptance, then system testing must happen at the conclusion of the Construction phase, at minimum.
* Verification may happen out-of-cycle and sometime after delivery if the capability does not require urgent verification, perhaps due to reduced criticality.
* Some capabilities may forego verification out of resource constraints: if the capacity of the Engineering team to produce software exceeds the capacity of the System Testing team to verify it, then certain noncritical verification activities will invariably be skipped.
* In the most critical of cases, verification may take place continuously throughout the Construction phase, provided the delivery squad can produce incremental releases. Final verification will be performed before handover.

During the Construction phase, Architects will work with the System Testing community to advise on upcoming changes to the system-level tests and acceptance criteria. System testing is discussed in more detail in Chapter 6.

## Light or heavy — you pick
The sequencing of the delivery phases offers a structured and progressive approach to problem-solving, and identifies accountability at various points throughout the delivery. This ensures that the right people perform the right tasks at the right time.

Time has shown that (software) engineering is a creative process, more so than a manufacturing one. The prevalence of Agile over Classical is a testament to that. (Possibly owing to marketing more than execution.) No two software projects will be the same. The purpose of the process model is, therefore, not to constrain people's movements or inhibit creativity. Rather, it is to encourage a pragmatic, risk-centric approach to problem-solving: the time and effort expended in each phase is informed by the degree of technical risk. To quote Boehm for a second time, "the project team must decide how much detail is enough".

CONTROL phases can be as lightweight as the team allows them to be. Not all capabilities will need a separate Ideation phase. Most requirements may have been prepared and validated ahead of time, so the Abstraction phase may only take a few days or a week. The Elaboration phase for a straightforward capability could go for one hour — the time to get through a white-boarding session and a pack of donuts. The phases can heavily overlap: we may start elaborating the design while the requirements are still being abstracted, so long as we feel that there's enough meat on the bone to sustain progress. Of course, these are best-cases, but a process model needs to be equally effective at scaling down as it is at scaling up.

# Insightful examples
The following illustrates of the delivery of three hypothetical product capabilities, named _X_, _Y_ and _Z_. Please read this section even if you think you know how the process model works; there are insights here that will enhance your understanding of it.

The horizontal axis represents time; major tick marks represent weeks.

![Process example X](images/diagrams-process-example-x.png)

_Capability delivery: Example X._

Capability _X_ is slated for delivery over at least two stages. It requires substantial analysis, which is suggested by the duration of the Abstraction and Elaboration phases. The first stage opens with a dedicated Ideation phase, which yields a product and architecture concept, as well as a feasibility report. The latter offers an indicative measure of the build duration and the cost to the business, and a recommendation to cease or continue based on the revenue projections from some initial business case. (Afterwards, the business case would be revised with the results of the feasibility study.)

The Ideation phase is useful in its ability to conduct preliminary analysis without incurring significant costs or taking up valuable delivery resources. In this example, it took two weeks to complete, involving only two people from the delivery organisation: a PO and an Architect, and the latter was involved part-time. 

If the business signs off on the revised business case, fantastic — the team will have useful work to do. If the initiative gets dropped, even better — the business will have saved time and money, and can focus on more worthwhile things!

Not every capability requires a feasibility study. Often, the business is willing to absorb substantial variability in costs and schedules — they just need it done. Alternatively, the capability may be required for compliance with some statute or regulation and is pinned to a deadline — it needs to be done all the same. Finally, technical capabilities may not require feasibility assessment — they are sponsored by the Architecture practice who may have performed their due diligence ahead of time.

The Ideation phase can also identify the prospective stages — increments of a capability. The first stage might be an MVP-style deliverable. Subsequent stages will refine the product, provided that the business is happy with the way it is progressing. They may decide to change tack or drop the product altogether. There is a delicate balance in binding stage scope, especially for the first stage of a complex product capability. If the MVP is too large, valuable time might be wasted before gaining feedback; conversely, small MVPs may not find their market due to their inadequacy.

The business dwells on the decision for the whole of two weeks, as they do, before deciding to sponsor the first stage of _X_. The results of the Ideation phase, while useful as a basis for technical work, are insufficient to start smashing out code. The go-ahead decision triggers the Abstraction phase, during which the PO and the Architect collaborate<sup>1</sup> to produce a requirements specification to a suitable level of abstraction. The idea is not to overspecify the requirements — a delicate balance achieved with the help of an experienced Architect. Once the requirements have been refined, they are presented to the business stakeholders for approval.

><sup>1 </sup>The PO is chiefly responsible for the essential output of this phase: the set of abstract requirements. The Architect advises the PO on the suitable level of abstraction and ensures that the most critical items have been covered by the PO.

Proceeding to the Elaboration phase, a PE has been assigned to the capability delivery and is now working with the Architect to refine the conceptual design into _something that can be built_. The extent of the work varies from case to case. For starters, it depends on the level of detail inputted by the Architect. In large and/or complex initiatives, the detail in the conceptual views will probably be lacking. The output detail also depends on the skills and experience of the Engineering team. Junior team members will need more guard rails, while seniors should be accorded more latitude. The PE takes a fundamentally risk-centric view of the solution: refining it to the point where the level of residual risk is tolerable<sup>2</sup>. 

><sup>2 </sup>Most of this is subjective. Outcomes improve with experience: the more we deal with technical risk, the better we get at handling it.

The Architect supports the PE in matters of design and takes accountability for ensuring that the resulting designs are conformant to the overarching system architecture and the principles guiding its evolution. The design sign-off comes from the Architect.

Once the PE feels that the essence of the design is in place, the Formation phase may commence.

Elaboration needn't be completely finished; the delivery squad may be formed regardless. For Stage 1 of _X_, the PE has decided to start recruiting the delivery squad before the design was fully elaborated. There were minor details left to iron out, which didn't appear to make a difference to the squad make-up. 

Where phases overlap, the sign-off of the current phase (if applicable) is required before the succeeding phase begins in earnest, although some initial groundwork can take place at the discretion of the person leading the current phase. In an overlapping Abstraction-Elaboration transition, business stakeholders should give their sign-off before we get too far into Elaboration. Similarly, when Elaboration and Formation overlap, the Architect is required to rubber stamp the design before we get too far into the briefing of the delivery squad. The definition of "too far" allows for some interpretation. Remember, CONTROL is risk-centric and we know that some risk is necessary to make progress. _How much risk, exactly?_ That is not a question that we may hope to answer precisely. And that is why we always put the most experienced people in charge of delivery.

>As a rule of thumb, one can defer sign-off for a phase _P_ until some constant fraction of the next phase, _P_ + 1, is complete. Let's say that fraction is one third. This is not a hard and fast rule, but it's better to have some guidance in place than to have none. I feel that one half is probably the limit, but even that is speculative. The more experienced the team, and the more honed their sense of risk, the further they will be able to push the limits. That said, _P_ + 2 certainly cannot start before _P_ has been signed off. This I am adamant on.

If the phase artifacts were signed-off before the phase was formally completed, it is possible that they may still change. In the majority of cases, the changes will be minimal. The person leading the phase should send revisions to their stakeholders (the business or Architecture, as the case may be) for final review with the changes clearly marked up.

>I've been able to convince several of my clients to store all design documentation in a Git repository. This really streamlines the review process. Instead of emailing mark-ups to reviewers, one can simply raise a Pull Request and include the audience in the reviewers list. Changes are automatically highlighted in diffs. Reviewers' comments are inline with the contentious text. When they have no further objections, they can merge the changes themselves. And conveniently, this process leaves a documented record of the review and its outcomes.

The sign-off-mostly-before model ensures that people don't waste time building things that mightn't be useful. There is a trade-off here, additional calendar time is consumed to avoid effort wastage, so that the overall productivity remains optimal. In other words, CONTROL does not attempt to deliver any given capability within the shortest amount of time. Instead, the risk-centric nature of CONTROL allows it to deliver the aggregate of all capabilities in the shortest amount of time.

After a brief consultation with the impacted EMs, it was becoming clear which Engineers would ideally form the delivery squad for _X_. Most of them were busy on BAU tasks and the tail-ends of other initiatives, but they put some time aside to attend the Formation workshops ran by the PE. Some time was spent on imparting the context: making sure that people understood the crux of the problem and the reasons for certain design decisions. Some of them were challenged initially but a consensus eventually formed. The Architect and the PO were in and out of the workshops, but were able to add some value nonetheless. 
 
The Formation workshops included some estimation activities, facilitated by a Project Coordinator. The delivery squad collectively broke the problem down into smaller chunks and produced a more refined set of estimates. People were estimating for themselves. And they had the complete problem context in front of them.

They also agreed on critical dependencies. Most of them were in the infrastructure space but one was a minor change to a gRPC API supplied by another team. The API change hadn't been spotted during Elaboration. The refined estimates, along with any additional decisions, were documented by the Project Coordinator. A follow-up ticket was raised with the infrastructure team to provision two PostgreSQL databases ahead of time.
 
Between workshops, the PE was refining the design, working through the minor edge-cases that were left off. The delivery squad took a week and a half to fully form. It was now ready to deliver.

The Construction phase lasted seven weeks and the squad would strive to release on a weekly cadence into a low-assurance, system integration environment. After the first four weeks, the releases were also targeting high-assurance, performance and functional verification environments, where they were tested by the System Testing team. The testers were briefed in advance by the Architect. Once verification passed, the System Testing team would progress the release through to the User Acceptance Testing (UAT) environment, where it was looked at by business people. By the time the Construction phase wrapped up and the final verification was completed, the business already had a good understanding of the capability. The final acceptance went off without a hitch.

Importantly, since the stakeholders had good visibility throughout the second half of the Construction phase, they grew confident in the product. So much so, that the business commissioned the second stage of the product's development before the first stage was formally delivered. This triggered a second Abstraction phase one week before the Construction phase ended, involving the same PO and Architect as before. The second Abstraction took a little longer than the first, although it actually had a smaller impact on timelines because of the overlap with the first Construction phase. The rest of the capability delivery proceeded in the same vein.

![Process example Y](images/diagrams-process-example-y.png)

_Capability delivery: Example Y._

Capability _Y_ is of a similar size and complexity to _X_, but took a very different path to delivery. The overall scope of the product included a several customer-facing interfaces — Web, iOS and Android. Android devices occupy the largest share of customers at 61%, followed by iOS at 30%, and the remaining 9% of customers use the website.

The Ideation phase took just two weeks. The PO and the Architect had sought to partition the overall scope into smaller deliverables, starting with an MPV on Android. However, upon presentation to the business stakeholders, their proposal was declined. The business were okay with the MVP concept in principle, but the company was planning a big advertising campaign prior to launch, so their response was "it's all or nothing".

Armed with the feedback, the Ideation team went back to the drawing board. Rather than sequencing the MVP part of the delivery over three stages, they had condensed it down to one, albeit large delivery stage. It would still be an MVP, but now an omnichannel one.

This time round, the business was eager to approve and sponsor the delivery. The Abstraction phase was relatively uneventful but Elaboration couldn't start for three weeks as there were no free PEs available to lead the delivery. The project stalled temporarily and our two protagonists got on with other matters. The PO was involved with other initiatives. The Architect, however, decided to dedicate a portion of her time to refining the conceptual design so that the PE could hit the ground running. She wanted to help the business deliver the product sooner.

It is worth pausing here to address the elephant in the room.

On one hand, this is a clear limitation of the CONTROL method: the strong reliance on skilled individuals means that capability delivery is inherently bottle-necked through a relatively small talent pool. A further drop in throughput occurs when PEs take leave or resign. Many Agile methods introduce artificial work-in-progress (WIP) limits that encourage teams to focus on a smaller set of tasks, avoid context switching, and promote the culture of "done". In CONTROL, the WIP is not artificial, it's a physical one!

On the other hand, having a low ratio of Principal Engineers to the totality of the Engineering staff is a symptom of a much larger problem. It is indicative of insufficient attention to people's skill and likely a result of poor hiring and performance improvement practices. In many ways, CONTROL is a litmus test of an organisation's ability to sustainably deliver complex software systems. When this ratio is low, the organisation will deliver reams of low-quality software if they were to embrace Agile, or smaller quantities of high-quality software should they opt for CONTROL.

CONTROL doesn't create the problem of underskilled staff, it only brings it into the foreground, where management is forced to confront it. They would have been in the exact same ditch without CONTROL, only it would look rosier and smell nicer.

We discuss the challenges of adopting CONTROL and possible mitigation strategies in Chapter 11. For now, capability _Y_ is a lesson learned for the delivery organisation. While it must address its performance in the mid/long-term, in the short-term they may consider —

1. **Adopting CONTROL for critical capabilities only**, allowing the less consequential products to be delivered in more conventional ways. Some team members may work in more conventional, Agile practices, drawing down a team backlog, while others may be seconded into CONTROL delivery squads.
2. **Engaging more people in areas with low delivery risks**. For instance, instead of having Principal Engineers lead all deliveries, lower-risk capabilities within a single Engineering team can be managed by a Staff Engineer or a Senior Engineer. This approach not only reduces dependence on PEs but also fosters skill development for future leadership roles. 

The first option may be viable when the abovementioned ratio is at its extreme. When one has too many people, their best option may be to carve out a niche within Engineering and incubate skills within this walled garden. On the other hand, if there are enough people who might be entrusted with smaller initiatives, the second option is better. This relieves PEs to focus on the more complex initiatives. The second option is useful even when you _think_ you have enough PEs, because you can never really have enough of them.

Returning to the example, it took about a week and a half to elaborate the design. Thanks to the Architect, in part, who had done a stellar work on the conceptual views.

Delivery then hit another snag. The impact analysis showed that the delivery squad should intersect five engineering teams: a back-end C++ team, a team looking after the Go-based API layer, and three front-end teams. The back-end, API and iOS teams could arrange for capacity within two weeks. However, the Android team was booked for the following month and the Web team couldn't start for another seven weeks. The PE felt that he didn't have a choice but to wait it out. Comms went out to the stakeholders. He picked up another capability in the meantime — a long-overdue refactoring initiative.

The problem we see here isn't a CONTROL one. Every project manager knows that a large, coordinated, and resource-intensive activity is really a dependency management problem in disguise. It is tackled by breaking down the problem, identifying interdependencies, and scheduling each subproblem accordingly.

The business didn't care whether the MVP would be delivered across one or three stages. All they cared about was that the public release across all three channels would be timed with the advertising campaign.

Did the Architect take the business's "all or nothing" remark too literally? There are, in fact, five distinct parts to the solution, and each may be delivered independently, provided there is a clear definition of cross-team interface contracts. Moreover, feature flags can be used to control when a feature is made available to customers. The iOS work could have been released before the other two front-ends in a "dark" state, then feature-toggled when the others were ready.

The error of the Architect was in the omission of feature flagging from the design. An experienced Architect should have realised that coordinated delivery is impractical at this scale. And while it takes more planning and more up-front interface design, it is better to decouple the component deliveries. This is a major architectural oversight.

The main mistake, however, rests with the PE. The Architect cannot predict which resources will be available and when. Neither can the PE, for that matter. But the PE is responsible for delivery planning. Having learned of the resource constraints, it would have been easy for the PE to break the MVP into three stages and maybe spend an extra week in Elaboration to firm up the interface definitions, if they weren't done so already. Stage 1 of the MVP could have been delivered with the C++, Go, and iOS teams. Stage 2 would have involved the Android team. Stage 3 — Web. The second and third stages wouldn't need Abstraction and Elaboration phases, as they could largely reuse the Stage 1 artifacts<sup>3</sup>.

><sup>3 </sup>Technically speaking, Stages 2 and 3 have zero-length Abstraction and Elaboration phases due to perfect artifact reuse and prior sign-offs from business stakeholders and the Architect.

There is a bit more work doing it this way. For starters, the PE needs to run three Formation phases, albeit with fewer participants. But rather than running three separate delivery squads, the initial delivery squad can simply expand and contract over time as more engineers are recruited from the later teams and decruited from the earlier teams.

_Errare humanum est._ No one is immune from such missteps and the delivery of large software projects requires numerous safety nets. Given the issues above, CONTROL recommends that large capabilities are backed by Project Coordinators who support PEs in delivery planning. The final decision, however, always rests with the PE, as does accountability for the delivery.

The Construction phase for Stage 1 of _Y_ takes just over a month to complete. The delivered product did not find its market and did not see further sponsorship from the business.

_Capability delivery: Example Z._

Capability _Z_ is a different kind of beast compared to the other two. It doesn't have an Ideation phase, suggesting that it doesn't benefit from a concept-level study. Each of the phases are relatively short, indicating that the delivery proceeds in fine-grained increments. Every phase overlaps its successor, suggesting a low to moderate levels of risk throughout the delivery. Finally, Stages 2 and 3 start before their predecessors complete, indicating that either the stages must be delivered unconditionally or there is ongoing oversight of the delivery by the capability's sponsor, promoting just-in-time next-stage authorisation. (The latter is akin to capability _X_.)

In fact, capability _Z_ is a large-scale refactoring initiative used to boost the performance of the in-house transactional engine. It's broken into stages — bounded sets of changes aimed at incrementally raising the performance — sequenced in priority order. The first stage entails a rewrite of the concurrency model, forecast to yield the greatest relative improvement in the overall query throughput. The second stage requires schema remodelling. The third stage is a rewrite of the query planner, which will make some queries more efficient. The fourth stage might not go ahead, depending on the outcomes of the first three.

_Z_ considered to be a _technical capability_ because it does not benefit any particular product in isolation. Instead, it is a strategic enabler that _extends the lifespan of the system_: it opens the door to the delivery of future product capabilities and gives existing products more headroom in handling business traffic.

The Architecture practice is the sponsor of this capability, which resides on their Technical Roadmap. There are no business stakeholders involved and no Product Owners. Architects are both stakeholders and "product" owners, in as far as a technical capability may be considered a product of their remit.

Akin to this example, the engineering teams will have their own Technical Roadmaps, scoping capabilities that can be delivered locally, without involving other teams. Again, no business stakeholders or Product Owners are permitted within a mile of delivery.

In commercial organisations, product capabilities will generally focus on revenue generation while technical capabilities address revenue protection. The perennial question is, _how should these be relatively prioritised?_

CONTROL does not address this issue directly. (In this edition, at least; future editions may be more prescriptive.) Nonetheless, I must caution the reader on the conflict of interest that may arise if the decision is allowed to rest with a non-neutral party. Product people, by definition, please the customer or the business, as the case may be. The Head of Product will naturally lean towards revenue-generating initiatives, and may occasionally give the nod to revenue-protecting initiatives that are "curative" in nature. In other words, those technical capabilities without which product delivery becomes stagnant or where the nonfunctional characteristics of the system perceptibly impact the customer experience. They are extremely unlikely to schedule technical capabilities of a "preventative" nature, as there is no impetus for them to do so.

I also advise against the use of "objective" economic measures to prioritise among product and technical capabilities. For example, requiring that every capability is associated with a business case that clearly shows the material gain to the business versus the cost of delivering the capability. This may (or may not) work for products, where material benefits can be estimated through competitor analysis, surveying customers to gauge product demand, and so forth. The material benefits of curative technical capabilities can also be estimated, as the costs of inaction is reasonably understood. To the best of my knowledge, there is no good way of estimating material benefits for preventative technical capabilities.

>Many distinguished economists are associated with specific theories, but only a few are honored by having a law named after them. British economist Charles Goodhart highlighted a problematic theme in the monetary management of the Bank of England (1975), which later became an oft-quoted adage — _Goodhart's Law_. It states that when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.

>The central idea behind Goodhart's fomulation may have been noticed earlier in India during British rule, later termed the _cobra effect_ by German economist Horst Siebert. In 1875, the British government, concerned with the number of cobras in Delhi, offered a bounty for every dead cobra. This was a successful strategy initially; large numbers of reptiles were killed. People soon realised that breeding cobras was easier than hunting them. The government eventually caught on and the reward program was scrapped. The breeders set their cobras free; the wild cobra population increased beyond the initial level.

>When an organisation habitually relies on objective measures to judiciously prioritise the interests of varying interest groups, those groups adapt by manipulating the numbers to their advantage. Software companies are no different. In 2016, while working for Australia's third-largest corporate bookmaker, I observed this firsthand. The executive heading product development had mandated a minimum of 3:1 ratio on revenue versus cost. I.e., a product had to turn a revenue in its first 12 months exceeding its development cost by a factor of 3. Every initiative I came across as a Solution Architect was rated at 3+, some only just. Later, that same executive travelled to the U.S. for an upscale MBA summit. He was bragging about it upon his return, telling everyone how the U.S. was light years ahead of Australia in turning profits by focusing in the right areas. The "cool kids" had apparently been running a 7:1 ratio. Which is what we would now do. It led to the fudging of estimates in the same proportion; they had been entirely arbitrary during the 3:1 days and their inflation to meet the 7:1 cutoff didn't change the weather. It did, however, result in numerous disappointments within the business, as most of the new products failed to meet their projected revenues. The credibility of the product organisation was utterly shattered. But at least we caught up to the Americans...

I suggest that product and technical capabilities are largely orthogonal and therefore incomparable. Rather than attempting to devise a metric for prioritising among them — a metric whose effectiveness will be short-lived at best — it is best to assign a variable ratio that distributes Engineering capacity between them. That ratio might initially be 50%; i.e., half of Engineering time is spent on delivering product capabilities and half on technical capabilities. The ratio may be revised at fixed intervals, for example, every six months. The head of the delivery organisation can qualitatively gauge the health of the system, perhaps with consultation from his trusted advisors, and make _small_ adjustments to the ratio — slide it by 5% at most. There should be a cap on the ratio, say, a minimum of 30% spent in either area. I accept that this is a wholly subjective measure but we need such subjective measures to keep equally subjective people at bay.

# Project management and tooling
Project management tools (e.g., Jira) are used for tracking work at two levels —

* **Capability level** — the end-to-end capability being delivered. This acts as a container for tasks and provides progress visibility to project managers and external stakeholders. Mapping to a tool like Jira, this will likely be represented using an Epic. 
* **Task level** — an item that can be delivered on in isolation. A task is the smallest thing that can be delivered by an individual.

CONTROL does not formally define a Project (or Programme) Manager (PM) role since enough literature exists on this topic — PMBOK and PRINCE2, for instance. PMs play an important role in resource planning, monitoring delivery, and ensuring that projects operate within their defined parameters and don't spin out of control. If anything, CONTROL encourages an external governance layer if it increases the chance of success. The project management office may, therefore, oversee the software project as a whole.

We also acknowledge the breadth of responsibilities placed upon the PE role in taking charge of capability delivery. They must provide technical guidance, group management, and delivery oversight. A dedicated Project Coordinator role may operate across several capability delivery streams, allowing the PEs to focus on technical activities.

# Concluding remarks
Elsewhere, problems are solved by interspersing a handful of very capable people among mostly average ones; everyone then picks off bite-sized chunks from a backlog with little context and no regard for technical risk. CONTROL differs from democratised approaches by getting the most capable people to lead those who have much to learn, providing valuable feedback and coaching along the way. The Principal Engineer role is the cornerstone of CONTROL. It is also key to sustainable growth, as we shall see in Chapter 8.

CONTROL has no Senior Engineering Manager role: EMs and PEs collectively handle all team responsibilities among them. EMs focus on the health of their teams and the components in their custody, while PEs focus on the delivery of new capabilities. They are supported by Architects and POs. There are no defined Product Managers. Managers of managers (MoMs) do not have a direct seat in the CONTROL delivery organisation. We elaborate on this in Chapter 7.

CONTROL does not require mundane ceremonies or an elaborate support entourage. There is no Scrum team. There are no sprints. No Agile Leads, Scrum Masters or Agile Coaches. Work breakdown is handled by PEs, supported by project specialists. Delivery is planning-enabled, risk-centric, context-rich, and, on the whole, accountability-driven.
