Chapter 8. Growth
---
The growth trajectory of engineering teams, while often celebrated as a sign of success, presents a nuanced challenge in organisational management. Successful teams expand with purpose and strategic alignment, leveraging internal talent and maintaining rigorous screening processes to sustain performance excellence. Conversely, poorly managed growth can lead to hurried hiring decisions, compromising on candidate vetting and culture fit. This chapter explores how these challenges are addressed within CONTROL.

# The growth challenge
Successful engineering teams invariably grow in size. Sadly, unsuccessful teams often expand too, and sometimes with more gusto. Team growth is therefore not a surefire indication of success, present or looming. Sadly, most bad hires are during times of growth. To expedite hiring, the rigour of screening processes is typically reduced, skipping steps that ensure candidates are thoroughly vetted — increasing the likelihood of hiring individuals who are not adequately qualified or aligned with the organisation's values (Ries, 2011, Harnish, 2014, and Collins 2001). Historical case studies of companies like Google have shown that even highly successful companies with multi-round screening processes are not immune to these challenges (Bock, 2015).

Growth is, in actuality, a _problem_ that must be managed.

It's easy to make recruitment mistakes under the pressures of growth. Hiring a mediocre developer is not ideal, but can often be spotted early and corrected, especially when the probation period is utilised properly. Filling a critical role with the wrong person is a much more egregious mistake, with significant and far-reaching effects on the organisation. Ineffective leaders can misguide strategic direction, resulting in a loss of competitive advantage and operational inefficiencies (Finkelstein, Hambrick, & Cannella, 2009). A leader who lacks the necessary skills can demoralise employees, leading to decreased engagement and productivity, and increased turnover.

CONTROL confronts growth challenges in several important ways:

1. **Supporting and encouraging internal recruitment:** PEs and EMs coach the engineers with a long-term view for career progression and personal succession. This isn't limited to day-to-day improvement; eventually, engineers may be offered EM or PE roles, depending on their skills and preferred direction. Rather than recruiting key personnel externally, talent is sourced from within. Ideally, only junior and mid-level engineers are sourced externally, as well as specialists who may be difficult to train in-house. Internal hires already understand the organisational culture, values, proprietary software, and processes. This familiarity reduces the time needed for cultural assimilation and increases the likelihood of a good fit.
2. **Fostering a culture of meritocracy:** The emphasis on individual performance weeds out mediocrity, ensuring control is passed to those who have developed the most, are most capable, and have the most to teach others. CONTROL's personal accountability model is not only ideal for promotion but also for dealing with flailing or languishing performance, resulting in a more timely intervention. It also ensures the teams don't become bogged down for long when an occasional hiring error is made.
3. **Extending planning times:** A long-term planning horizon accords leadership a precious commodity — time. One enjoys more time to plan for engineering capacity, determining what sort of skills the organisation will need and when.

>The importance of internal hires cannot be understated. A University of Pennsylvania study of personnel data from a U.S. banking firm has indicated that workers promoted into jobs have significantly better performance than workers hired into similar jobs for the first two years. They also have lower rates of voluntary and involuntary exit. Paradoxically, the external hires were initially paid on average 18% more than the promoted workers (Bidwell, 2011). The study was aptly named "Paying more to get less".

On the flip side, and notwithstanding the preference for internal hiring, the internal talent pool cannot always fulfil growth needs. It may be that the people are not yet ready to take on greater challenges. Or that the competencies needed for a new role do not exist in the organisation. Economics may play a role as well: sometimes it may be more cost-effective to hire similar skills in a different geographical location.

# Going to market
Hiring should _prioritise_ individual skills over team and culture fit. To be clear, "prioritise" not "preclude". Engineers are hired mainly on technical merit, with rigorous skills testing. Candidates who are truly objective and not beholden to their egos will fit the sort of culture you'll want to cultivate. There are other sorts of "team players" too: serial agree-ers, experts in yes-manship, nonconfrontational-ists, the entirely unopinionated, and the pathologically indifferent. Pass them on without hesitation, for they are needed elsewhere to pad the ranks of "superstar teams".

Prioritising individual skills is bound to cause dismay among many readers. This is perhaps a result of three decades of systematic conditioning of the software engineering community into believing that team fit is the dominant recipe for a high-performing organisation. There is no evidence to indicate that team dynamics are a _stronger contributing factor_ to overall performance than individual skills, despite the existence of many studies highlighting the importance of teamwork. Given identical individual skills, cohesive teams of skilled people outperform incohesive teams of skilled people. Teams of skilled individuals generally function regardless but not as well as when they are part of an effective team. Because individual skills are held as a control variable, people wrongfully assume that team cohesion is the main factor impacting overall performance. They don't consider the alternative of reversing the variables: when team cohesion is kept as the control variable and skills are varied, will cohesive teams of skilled people mop the floor with cohesive teams of unskilled people?

Context is, as always, crucial. The impact of team cohesion on overall performance varies dramatically with the degree of task interdependence. In studies comprising tasks involving collective problem-solving and a high degree of intercommunication, cohesion proved to be a crucial factor: ineffective communication became a bottleneck to performance. However, as tasks became more segmented and thus independent, problem-solving ability dominated the outcome (Rico & Cohen, 2004). (The tasks were of a numerical nature and participants communicated using a chat application.) Software engineering tasks belong in the "mostly independent"<sup>1</sup> category, and the transition to more decentralised and remote working arrangements has biased problem decomposition to favour independence.

><sup>1 </sup>Another reason that comparing engineering and sporting teams is a bad idea. Team sports nearly always require players to engage in highly interdependent tasks, where their ability to interact is critical to the team's success. Imagine a team sport in which players were mostly autonomous with relatively few interactions. Would teamwork affect the outcome to the same degree as individual skills? Let's not kid ourselves, computer programming is not synchronised swimming.

>Scientifically inclined minds (and connoisseurs of great analogies) may recall that changes in control variables can sometimes have a more profound effect on the dependent variable than the independent variable. Nowhere is this more evident than in biology: In a plant growth experiment, if light exposure (a control variable) varies, it will have a more significant impact on growth than the fertiliser type (the independent variable) being tested. The variations in sunlight would overshadow the effects of different fertilisers (Taiz & Zeiger, 2010); ergo, if the fertiliser was made the control variable, the effect of sunlight on plant growth would have a far greater magnitude. In other words, if you had to pick between good sunlight (with average soil) or good fertiliser (with average sunlight), you would generally pick good sunlight, unless you were growing mushrooms. (How's that for a programmer analogy?) It is also one reason that certain plants will not grow in some locations, no matter what organic goodness has been added.

CONTROL is unapologetically performance-focused and science-based. Causal links between personal accountability and group performance have been known in behavioural science for over 110 years (Ringelmann, 1913). It is for this reason that CONTROL is founded on personal accountability.

Regarding individual skills and team performance, a pertinent question is "Why can't we have both?" Personal accountability is much more than a stimulation of individual performance. Accountability may be used to either incentivise or deter any element of behaviour that is 1) known to the individual, 2) uniquely attributable to the individual, 3) within their control, and 4) measurable.

What if we simply took the list of personal accountabilities and expanded it to include factors that positively influence teamwork? Ones like —

* Open and honest communication;
* Constructive feedback (giving and receiving); and
* Respect for others' opinions.

These are uniquely attributable and measurable, even if somewhat subjective. They are certainly within people's control and can be made known to them. So, CONTROL encodes precisely these factors into the accountability model.

# Continuous screening
No interview screening process is entirely foolproof. A study of almost 5,000 managers in 13 countries has shown that 39% of the first signs of hiring remorse appear within a recruit's first week on the job (Half, 2017). By the end of the second week, 39% of employers have heard the penny drop. Surprisingly, having identified underperformance, 32% adopted a "wait and see" approach in the hope that performance will improve on its own. _Why would performance improve its own?_

Few managers genuinely believe that a problem appearing this early is likely to resolve itself. If a wheel were to fall off your new car within a fortnight, wouldn't you tow it back to the dealership at once and dump it in the manager's parking spot? Behavioural science again has the answer, this time with a little help from game theory. If the engineering manager's list of accountabilities does not clearly cover individuals' performance, their attention will turn to defending the team when underperformance is eventually pointed out at a higher level. A team is not an accountable entity and is hence beyond reproach. At the very least, a team is easier to defend. One may always argue that blaming the team leads to unfair generalisation.

Social comparison will invariably kick in. Other managers will catch on and end up doing the same, perceiving a greater payoff in inaction. The performance norm is recalibrated, exonerating previously underperforming teams, while the overall performance of the organisation winds up in a death spiral. This spiral can only be reversed when some managers, perhaps in search of a promotion, determine to appear superior to their peers and perceive a greater payoff in enforcing their teams' performance.

>This is not cynicism but a sobering reality. If, as a current or aspiring Head of Engineering, you find yourself questioning aloud the performance of your Engineering cohort after a period of neglect, you're almost guaranteed to be barking up the wrong tree. Most engineers will have done nothing wrong and will not appreciate the generalisation. Instead, focus your energy on identifying and dealing with the _individuals_ accountable.
>
>If you cannot find the individuals accountable, then may I suggest that you walk up to a mirror. Or, at the very least, consider implementing an accountability model.

Since occasional bad hires are inevitable and can mostly be spotted during the first few weeks on the job, probation periods must be used effectively by both EMs and PEs to assess new hires. The problems highlighted above are a direct consequence of missing or misaligned accountability. CONTROL codifies the accountabilities precisely so that these problems may be avoided or dealt with sooner. While PEs are instrumental in providing feedback, the accountability for individual performance management lies squarely with the EM. 

While probation periods are useful to mitigate bad hires, there is no guarantee that a good hire will maintain or increase their performance level throughout their tenure. And it may not be their fault; there may be cultural hurdles, issues with management, tensions with colleagues or stakeholders, problems at home, and other factors outside their sphere of control. While traditional annual reviews have their place, there is a need for continuous feedback and development opportunities. This means spending time with people to understand the types of challenges they are facing, which may be entirely different to their manager's understanding. The precise mechanism by which feedback is obtained and performance is gauged is outside the scope of CONTROL; however, the accountability model prescribes that whatever was expected of the employee must have been known to them and within their ability, and it's their manager's responsibility to ensure this. 

The strength of a well-thought-out accountability model isn't just in the measurement of performance, but in safeguarding individuals' rights and ensuring that people are provided everything they need to be successful. When an engineer fulfils their responsibilities, and communicates any resource gaps and other challenges to their manager, who in turn fulfils their responsibilities, the organisation will reach "performance nirvana". The reason this is not occurring today in most organisations is due to a misaligned accountability model or a total lack of one. Inadequate accountability impedes the execution of responsibilities and effective communication of resource gaps and challenges. When accountability is not upheld at every level, from individual employees to management, it leads to breakdowns in the system and a departure from optimal performance. 

# Progression within leadership
While engineers may grow into the EM or PE roles, the latter may also want to try their hand at strategic planning. Anecdotally, it is the PEs who will likely pursue the software architecture path<sup>2</sup> — trading their tools for a more overarching set of responsibilities and longer planning horizons. CONTROL makes this transition seamless and natural, subjecting PEs to skills and experiences that are invaluable for strategic planning and architectural roles:

* **Abstract problem solving**: PEs routinely work with Architects, engaging in high-level design and decision-making processes. This helps PEs develop an understanding of abstract problem-solving, engineering and architectural principles, and the broader scope of solution delivery.
* **Credibility and influence**: PEs build rapport and credibility through their deep technical expertise and the coaching and mentoring of frontline engineers. This credibility is crucial for Architects, who build on stakeholder trust to drive architectural decisions and strategic initiatives.
* **Collaboration and leadership**: PEs collaborate across teams via the delivery squad model, taking the lead role in capability delivery. They must effectively communicate complex technical concepts to diverse audiences, an essential skill for Architects who bridge the gap between business goals and technical execution.
* **Domain knowledge**: PEs gain deep domain knowledge throughout their journey. This knowledge is vital for Architects, who must design solutions that are not only technically sound but also aligned with the strategic needs of the business.

><sup>2 </sup>Sadly, there is no reliable data on the lineage of the Software Architect role. A behavioural science analogy of the physics law of momentum conservation will suggest that Principal Engineers, having maintained a tech-focused career trajectory for several years, will unlikely depart from it in the future.

EM will generally pursue a more management-focused career path. At its core, CONTROL does not recognise a MoM role in the delivery organisation, for reasons that were already explained. EMs can use CONTROL as a springboard to middle or top management, perhaps to a Head of Engineering, but in doing so forfeit their seat at the delivery table. Similarly, Architects and Product Owners may ascend to higher roles, departing the delivery organisation in the process. Their energy will be channelled towards a greater purpose: MoMs leverage their accumulated knowledge, skills, and experiences to influence and shape the broader strategic direction of their department or the broader organisation. Crucially, they mentor and develop the next generation of leaders, cultivating a pipeline of talent ready to take on future challenges.

# Chalk outlines
## The lack of accountability
I make a Seinfeldian<sup>3</sup> argument when I claim that the lack of a "performance nirvana" in most organisations is due to a misaligned accountability model or a total lack of one. I complete it thusly: if most managers knew the first thing about accountability, the software crisis _may_ have ended by now.

><sup>3 </sup>In the episode named "The Alternate Side", Jerry is in a verbal joust with a car rental clerk. Jerry earlier made a reservation for a car, but the rental company gave it to another customer. She claims to know what a car reservation entails. Jerry argues the contrary: if she knew, he would've had a car by now. It is a method of _reductio ad absurdum_ — an argument by contradiction. A weak argument in this case, because it omits the other potential causes, but an entertaining one all the same. (The correct inference is that "if she knew, he _may have_ had a car by now". It just doesn't sound as comedic.)

There is evidence, both anecdotal and empirical, to suggest that accountability is lacking in the modern workforce:

* Bregman (2016) points out the confusion between accountability and blame, and highlights the need for accountability across all levels of the management hierarchy. 
* Gallup (2015) in the "State of the American Manager" report estimates that only ten per cent of managers possess the talent to effectively manage. Many managers lack the ability to hold their employees accountable, set clear expectations, and give constructive feedback. This lack of clarity results in duplicated efforts, overlooked tasks, and increased organizational politics. Gallup also estimates that the manager accounts for at least 70% of the variance in employee engagement scores across business units. So, if the manager is unaware of accountability, the likelihood of employee engagement and productivity diminishes greatly.
* Brown, Chheng, Melian, Parker, & Solow (2015), in the Deloitte "Global Human Capital Trends" report, remark on the existing lack of accountability. They emphasise that organisations must begin holding leaders accountable for a strong and enduring culture to flourish.
* Madgavkar, Schaninger, Maor, White, Smit, Samandari, Woetzel, Carlin, & Chockalingam (2023), in McKinsey's "Performance Through People" report, recommends that companies examine whether they need greater accountability and whether they are challenging employees to grow. The report criticises organisations for accepting underperforming employees and warns of the possible negative impacts on accountability and expectations. It suggests that much of the "low-hanging fruit" may be harvested by tightening up processes and accountability. It provides examples of successful organisations that have flattened their management hierarchies and focused instead on accountability.

My own experience has led me to conclude something similar: most organisations simply don't understand what accountability means and routinely confuse it with responsibility. I do not believe my experience to be unique in this regard.

## Prioritising individual skills over team and culture fit
I worry that no matter how many times I clarify that hiring should not preclude team skills, the meaning of prioritising individual skills will be misunderstood.

So, I suggest an alternate perspective. _Those screening the candidate must assume that the hire will turn out to be a dud._ If you are repelled by such an outlook, substitute "will" with "could" (and "dud" with "failure to meet expectations"), but I prefer the more cautious, if provocative, stance<sup>4</sup>.

><sup>4 </sup>This assumption is a strategic tool rather than a pessimistic worldview.

Suppose the hire lacks team skills or doesn't fit in, despite being technically competent. Perhaps they are not objective enough, overly defensive, and do not take criticism well. Or they're insensitive and overly combative, and do not give constructive criticism. Maybe they just keep to themselves and avoid sharing knowledge. At any rate, misfits will become apparent very early — the first few weeks or months — as feedback from the frustrated team members floods in. It should be possible to intervene and resolve the matter quickly, especially during the probation phase. The person may be coached, reassigned, or discharged — the outcome is irrelevant to the discussion. The key metric here is the time to diagnose the problem.

Now, suppose the hire gets along well with everyone but lacks technical skill. Can we rely on timely feedback? People don't easily criticise their teammates once a good relationship has formed. It can take time before people feel frustrated with their colleague's performance to the extent that it overshadows their relationship. We can only rely on the manager to make objective recommendations, which may take some time to form. In turn, the manager may not be entirely independent in their assessment; they may also be guided by feedback. 

Furthermore, new hires are usually given ample time to settle in, particularly in brownfield environments with existing (and often complex) software systems. There may be very little expectation of technical performance in the first month or two. But team skills will be assessed from day one.

As unsettling as it sounds, the quicker a person agitates their teammates, the sooner the problem will be spotted. Those who lack technical skills, especially at a senior level, would have coasted through many unsuspecting workplaces. They would have presumably adapted by learning to get along with colleagues. You'll catch on to them eventually — or not — but the organisation will have lost valuable time in the best case.

Consider the constraints and challenges of a typical hiring process. Condensed time frames: one or two interviews at most, and perhaps a technical assessment. Combined with the pressure to hire, a steady stream of mediocre candidates, and the fear that a good candidate may go elsewhere while we dwell on the decision. The reality is that one has a narrow window of opportunity to assess the candidate. It would be wise, therefore, to treat this opportunity as a risk reduction exercise — prioritise the types of traits that will otherwise take time to surface once the candidate is given the green light.

With the above in mind, I stress that hiring should prioritise individual skills, with some coverage of team skills. And the more condensed the hiring process, the more the priority should shift towards technical merit. For it is less risky to do so, compared to fixating on those traits that are quickly spotted on the job.

# Summary
The chapter explored the complexities and pitfalls associated with managing growth within engineering teams. Team expansion, while often perceived as a marker of success, can also lead to organisational challenges if not managed carefully. There is a clear risk of rushed hiring decisions during growth phases, which can result in mismatches in skills and cultural alignment.

CONTROL's approach to mitigating these challenges is through prioritising internal recruitment and succession to leverage existing cultural familiarity and reduce onboarding time. Internal recruitment requires a delivery organisation that promotes personal development through coaching and mentoring. It takes the most experienced kind of people to nurture and grow others.

Another important concept is one of personal accountability, where rigorous performance metrics and continuous screening ensure that the right individuals are not only hired but also nurtured for long-term success within the organisation. By fostering a culture of meritocracy and personal accountability, CONTROL aims to uphold performance standards amidst team expansions and during steady-state operation.

Ultimately, CONTROL calls for a measured approach where growth is managed with strategic foresight and a commitment to maintaining high standards of individual performance. By shaping recruitment practices around succession and accountability, engineering teams can navigate growth phases effectively while safeguarding their competitive edge and operational efficiency.

# Concluding remarks
Many hiring tranches are fuelled by the assumption that engineering problems are infinitely partitionable. Evidently, most managers haven't read The Mythical Man-Month. A twenty-person team will never be as productive per capita as a ten-person team, which, in turn, will not match a five-person team. Sure, some methods scale better than others, but growth is a game of diminishing returns. As Fred Brooks put it with only the slightest exaggeration, "Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later." (Brooks, 1975.)

When looking to grow a well-functioning and highly productive team, the first question you must ask is whether the problem is one of capacity or prioritisation. Many capacity concerns are a mismanagement of priorities and a misallocation of resources in disguise. Once the business gets its priorities straight, its capacity problems will disappear.
