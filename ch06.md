Chapter 6. People
---
You cannot create software without people. Every line of code, every unit test, every interface is crafted by individuals who bring their expertise, creativity, and unique perspectives to the project. People are the heartbeat of any software development endeavor. While tools, technologies, and methodologies are critical, it is the people who use them that drive the success or failure of a project. 

Ensuring that everyone is able to collaborate takes structure, discipline, and above all else, a clear demarcation of people's responsibilities. This chapter explores the latter.

# Individuals and teams
The previous section discussed squads and teams as the means for delivering and maintaining product capabilities, respectively. But the emphasis was on individual responsibilities. Its best to clear the air now, before we proceed much further.

Both Classical and Agile methodologies fail to recognise and promote individual skills. Contemporary software practices erase individuality, substituting it with the amorphous and overglorified notion of a team. But it's not the team that gets woken at 3 AM, but the individual. It is the individual that finds the elusive bugs. And it is the individual that has the occasional breakthrough moment. The team guarantees long-term asset ownership, provides a support network for its members, and offers them a sense of camaraderie, no more, no less.

> How do you convince someone? Why, with an analogy, of course. In Agile, we love the sports analogy: "would you rather a superstar team or a team of superstars?" A superstar sports team is obviously going to be more effective, and engineering teams must therefore work identically.
>
> The above is an example of the strawman logical fallacy. The resemblance between professional sports teams and everyday engineering teams is superficial. Take premier league football. Professional teams comprise athletes who have trained their whole life, made considerable sacrifices, and are exceptional individually. They work effectively together precisely because of their individual abilities and an overwhelming desire to win. They also heavily specialise: a defender's skills and training regime differ from that of a striker. The team is a platform enabling them to be successful and showcase their individual abilities. It's also mandated by the sporting code; it is a team of eleven or nothing.
>
> Most engineering teams are nothing like a premier league line-up. To even assemble a sizeable "team of superstars", would take more money and time than most engineering outfits can afford. In practice, most teams comprise a diverse mixture of skills and experience. You'll be lucky to have one or two stars; the rest will be developers of average skill. Who do you think will be scoring the goals? Everyone may be on the same proverbial playing field, but make no mistake — the others are there learning to dribble.
>
> If one draws an analogy to make a point, they must be prepared to go all the way. In soccer, the team manager (or head coach) has wide-ranging responsibilities, including selecting the team and their formation, choosing the tactics, coaching and motivating players. Teamwork is hugely important. So important in fact, that it cannot be left to the team to organise; it is the responsibility of one person (who is accountable). Other team sports work the same way. The idea of an entirely self-organising professional sporting team is an absurdity.

Cohesive, well-functioning teams are indispensable assets of any engineering organisation, and I'm not about to argue otherwise. I'm merely pointing out that a team cannot exist without its members and yields no value in and of itself. It yields little value when its members are mostly unskilled, irrespective of their collaborative qualities. It takes a certain composition for a team to amplify the value of its members, before it can be genuinely referred to as being greater than the sum of its parts. Those that have realised this, cultivate the team from skilled and objective individuals. Those who haven't, hire "team players".

Have you ever sent an email to a large group of responsible colleagues, asking a simple question or assigning a simple task, and never received so much as a response?

Congratulations, you have experienced _Coordination Loss_ — a part of the _Ringelmann Effect_. It was first identified by French agricultural engineer Max Ringelmann in 1913 and provides valuable insights into group accountability and social loafing. This phenomenon refers to the tendency for individuals to exert less effort when working on a collective task in a group compared to when working alone. 

The results of Ringlemann's studies were successfully replicated by several researchers (Ingham, Levinger, & Peckham, 1974, and Latané, Williams, & Harkins, 1979) and some of them elaborated on his conclusions. Their findings include:

1. **Diminished individual effort**: Experiments involved tasks such as rope pulling, where participants were asked to pull on a rope either individually or as part of a group. Ringelmann found that as the size of the group increased, individual effort decreased. This suggests that individuals may feel less accountable for their contributions when working in a group, leading to a diffusion of responsibility.
2. **Coordination loss**: In larger groups, coordination becomes more challenging, and individuals may perceive their contributions as less consequential, leading to a reduction in effort. Additionally, individuals may engage in social loafing, where they exert less effort because they believe others will compensate for their lack of effort.
3. **Social comparison**: Individuals may compare their own effort level to that of others within the group. If they perceive that others are exerting less effort, they may feel justified in reducing their own effort, leading to a downward spiral of collective performance.
4. **Task interdependence**: The effect's magnitude can vary depending on the degree of task interdependence. In tasks where individual contributions are less visible, the Ringelmann Effect may be more pronounced. Conversely, in tasks where individual contributions are essential for achieving the group's goals, the effect may be mitigated.

The Ringelmann Effect has important implications for group accountability and performance management. To mitigate the negative impact of social loafing and diffusion of responsibility, organisations must implement strategies to underscore personal accountability within groups. CONTROL does precisely that.

# Roles, responsibilities and accountabilities
CONTROL introduces roles sparingly, but each role is carefully defined with true purpose and to minimise overlap. Crucially, each role is associated with a distinct set of accountabilities and no two sets of accountabilities overlap.

Roles in CONTROL are not of equal importance and certainly not democratic<sup>1</sup> by any stretch. The most important role, by far, is that of the Principal Engineer — a _master craftsman_ by a different name. Principal Engineers are the most skilled individuals, proficient in a wide range of techniques and tools. Not only do they design and deliver high quality software but coach others around them. They are assigned the most wide-ranging responsibilities.

><sup>1 </sup>Those who obsess over inclusivity will probably find these words alarming. You may be assured that no organisation treats everyone equally and not everyone has the same say, which is reflected in their responsibilities (and salaries). Scrum cleverly pretends otherwise, introducing the servant-leader narrative so that people will follow willingly and voluntarily.

### Principal Engineer
Engineering skill is the most scarce commodity that an Engineering organisation has. And skilled Principal Engineers (PEs) are the scarcest of all. Many organisations employ PEs to clean up the "side effects" of the more "productive" members of Engineering. They become very effective (and well-compensated) "firefighters". 

CONTROL takes a different approach. It employs PEs to proactively avoid these "side effects" and train other Engineers, so that they may someday do the same.

PEs take charge of capability delivery, ensuring from the outset that the software is developed in an efficient and sustainable manner, and meets stakeholder expectations. PEs —

+ Work with Architects to refine designs.
+ Work with POs to clarify requirement details.
+ Are involved in effort estimation activities.
+ Break down the work and manage end-to-end delivery:
  - Work breakdown is initially coarse-grained during planning (Elaboration);
  - Fine-grained breakdown may be with the assistance of Engineers within the squad (Formation).
+ Recruit delivery squads.
+ Oversee the quality of the delivered artifacts.
+ Lay the initial software groundwork where necessary.
+ Coach Engineers on technical matters.
+ Provide feedback to EMs around skills gaps or behavioural concerns.
+ Assist EMs in the screening of engineering hires.
+ Advise on engineering principles, patterns and guidelines.
+ Collaborate with Project Coordinators in tracking and managing project parameters.

**Accountable for**:

- End-to-end delivery of product capabilities.
- Negotiating expectations through time and resource estimation:
  + Expectations lie on both the Engineering and Product sides: the Product team knows what will be delivered and roughly when, while Engineering knows what is being asked of them and the constraints they must meet.
- Ensuring that delivery proceeds within planned parameters and communicating delivery anomalies. (See note on project coordination below.)

Given a complex system, the end-to-end scope of a PE's engagement may expose them to a very broad technology stack. They may, for example, have to ride shotgun over changes to a Java-based back-end, a Node.js-based serving layer, and a pair of front-end clients — one written in React.js and another in Swift. There could be different kinds of databases and message brokers involved. Moreover, their next engagement may intersect a different set of engineering teams and throw them at a yet another set of technologies. A pertinent question might be, _how does a Principal Engineer keep abreast of these technologies?_

A PE should be proficient in one or more contemporary programming languages, ideally from different disciplines. They should be familiar with some forms of persistence technologies and message-orientated middleware. They should probably hold a degree in Engineering or Computer Science. But there are only so many unicorns for hire; PEs cannot possibly know everything and operate authoritatively in every area. 

The earlier question misses the point. It is not the PE's role to micromanage engineers or tell people how to do their jobs. A PE should be backed by a capable and well-motivated delivery squad; its members supported by competent and accountable Engineering Managers. In addition, members of the delivery squad do not produce code in isolation: all code should undergo a peer review process, if such is the mandated practice within Engineering.

A PE is, first and foremost, a professional _problem solver_. They are able to _analyse_ (pull apart complex problems), _abstract_ (discard nonessential detail), _generalise_ (infer commonality from specifics), and _synthesise_ (combine small parts to form a whole). They have a solid grasp of design patterns, programming paradigms (imperative, declarative, objected-orientated, functional, etc.), engineering principles, and a strong intuition for architectural form.

A large part of a PE's role is to coach engineers and collaborate with EMs to identify and address skills gaps. One does not have to be a Java expert to spot "smells" in someone's Spring application. There are telltale signs when someone's cutting a corner or struggling with a particular problem. This is the value that a skilled PE brings to the table.

PEs carry a lot on their shoulders, responsible for both the technical aspects of the solution and its delivery. A natural question arises: _can one person cope?_

When a delivery squad intersects, say, up to three Engineering teams, I believe that the answer is a resounding _yes_. Remember, a PE is not bound to a Agile Release Train (or some non-SAFe equivalent), where they would otherwise have to juggle multiple team backlogs and deal with different team members each day. In CONTROL, the delivery squad acts as a stable construct that lives for as long as the stage. The PE works with a small company of people, day in, day out, until the stage objectives have been met. The delivery squad will have its own processes and ceremonies for handling communication and spotting problems and blockers. This goes back to the earlier axiom that there cannot be accountability without authority. (See Chapter 4.) The delivery squad model provides PEs with the visibility needed to stay on top of delivery.

When the delivery squad intersects four or more Engineering teams, we enter the "maybe" and "it depends" territory. It becomes a grey area, where multiple factors may be influencing the outcome: technical complexity, number of people, resource constraints, schedules, and so forth. The CONTROL recommendation is to appoint a Project Coordinator to the delivery squad, so that the PE can delegate some of their responsibilities (such as progress tracking, resource management, reporting, and escalation) to a specialist. _This does not alter accountability._ The PE is still the accountable party who has elected to delegate responsibility in this case.

The distinction between three and four-plus (Engineering teams) is not a hard and fast rule. The need for a Project Coordinator and their commitment level is largely at the discretion of the PE. We entrust PEs with delivery, so we give them the latitude they need to be successful.

### Architect
Architects provide strategic leadership within the technical domain, ensuring that the system architecture evolves in accordance with business needs. Architects advise and collaborate with —

+ POs during Ideation of product capabilities.
+ POs on capability specifications and suitable levels of abstraction.
+ PEs on capability design.
+ STMs on test design and acceptance criteria.
+ EMs on team-level Technical Roadmaps.
+ EMs and PEs on engineering principles, practices and guidelines.

Architects take a long-term perspective on —

+ System architecture and principles governing its evolution.
+ Capability planning and design.
+ The system-level Technical Roadmap, comprising curative and preventative technical capabilities.
+ Nonfunctional characteristics.
+ Architectural patterns and guidelines.

**Accountable for**:

- Alignment of the system architecture with long-term business objectives.
- Adequate detail in the requirements specification.
- Conformance with organisational and regulatory constraints, at the system level.
- Suitability of technology selection.
- Alignment of architectural and technology decisions with current and prospective engineering capabilities.

The last point is worth remarking on. It's one thing to design a hypothetical system that satisfies organisational needs. Making its realisation attainable to the engineering teams that the company has at its disposal, or can reasonably upskill within known constraints, is an altogether different problem. Architects are empowered to take certain risks in making ambitious, far-reaching decisions; they must moderate the degree of risk that the organisation is being exposed to.

It should be noted that although the availability of suitable skills is the accountability of Engineering Managers, some aspects of recruitment and training will invariably lie outside their control. Because accountability cannot extend beyond one's authority, architectural demands cannot venture outside of skills boundaries without prior agreement with engineering management.

Architecture may be thought of as a technical risk management activity (Stoneburner et al., 2002, and Hope et al., 2005). When any nontrivial software project is first conceived, the degree of risk is intolerably high. Architects collaborate with other strategists (for example, the Product team) to reduce technical risk to an acceptable level. Risk mitigation goes through the cycle of prioritising, implementing, and maintaining risk-reducing controls, and is a continuous process. Architects are, therefore, constantly balancing risk with ambition.

## Engineering Manager
Engineering Managers (EMs) look after the long-term interests of their team and the health of the software components under their remit. EMs —

+ Ensure team cohesion and handle personnel matters.
+ Ensure adequate skills exist and evolve suitably over time.
+ Are responsible for hiring and performance management.
+ Are responsible for software components within their team's remit:
  - Conformance of the software with engineering guidelines and best-practices;
  - Maintainability and supportability of the software; and
  - Meeting nonfunctional constraints.
+ Advise on engineering principles, patterns and guidelines:
  - This responsibility they share with PEs and, to a lesser extent, Architects.
+ Advise PEs on the as-built state and changes necessary to deliver a capability.
+ Track and manage technical debt and the Technical Roadmap scoped to the team.
* Shield the team from difficult stakeholders.
+ Guarantee the continuity of knowledge and reduction of key personnel risks.
* Facilitate continuous improvement initiatives, retrospectives (if such is the adopted practice), and follow up on actions.
* Scout technology and tooling that may assist teams in the longer term.
* Optimise BAU processes, focusing on system observability and supportability.

**Accountable for**:

- Availability of suitably skilled individuals to fulfil delivery objectives.
- Communicating resource gaps in a timely manner.
- A safe and suitable working environment for their reports.
- Ensuring the maintainability and supportability of software assets within their remit.
- Ensuring that software meets the quality objectives stated in the nonfunctional requirements.

Whether the engineering teams' makeup includes testers is left largely to their managers' discretion. EMs are accountable for delivery staffing and the meeting of quality objectives, and may therefore choose to transfer some of the underlying responsibilities to specialised testers. CONTROL generalises the freedom to recruit specialist skills, as per the "availability of suitably skilled individuals" accountability clause. This covers skills such as Graphic Design, User Experience Design, Data Science, Technical Writing, Information Security, DevOps, and various domain expertise (e.g., mathematics, hardware design, etc.).

Some organisations refer to this role as an Engineering Team Lead or Lead Engineer. CONTROL specifically refers to this role as a "manager", which stresses its accountability. Indeed, the role is is focused on management, while leadership, empathy, foresight and organisation are its essential qualities. When we refer to a company having done poorly, we say it was "mismanaged" not "mislead".

## Product Owner
Product Owners (POs) provide a mixture of strategic and tactical leadership within the product domain, ensuring that the delivered products meet business needs. POs —

+ Specify the end-to-end functional and nonfunctional characteristics of product capabilities.
+ Focus on product verticals, not engineering teams. 
+ Proactively influence the evolution of the product based on industry trends and organisational vision and goals.
+ Collaborate with Architects during Ideation, producing a Product Concept and (where applicable) a Feasibility Report.
+ Responsible for the applicability and fitness of the product capabilities within their remit.
+ Offer product guidance and subject matter expertise to both the business stakeholders and the Engineering practice.
+ Interface with the business so that all key stakeholders are represented.
+ Represent the business interests in general.

**Accountable for**:

- Alignment of delivered capabilities with business needs.
- Conformance with organisational and regulatory constraints, at the product level.

We note that "conformance with organisational and regulatory constraints" resembles a similarly phrased accountability clause for Architects. The distinction is largely in the _product_ vs _technology_ aspects:

* Architects ensure that the technical aspects of the system are compliant. For example, the software meets specific secure coding standards.
* POs ensure that the product capabilities are compliant. For example, the offered features are legal in the jurisdiction where the product will be deployed.

POs do not form exclusive affiliations with Engineering teams. Instead, they liaise with delivery squads and operate across teams to deliver end-to-end capabilities.

>Many organisations make the error of assigning POs to specific Engineering teams on a permanent basis, each becoming responsible for their team's backlog. I have experienced this firsthand at two of my clients, both professing their "agility". When a product delivery involves multiple teams, multiple POs collaborate on the problem. They typically self-organise and interact directly to complete the task in concert.
>
>This model is not an effective one, for two main reasons.
>
>Firstly, in sufficiently large systems, individual Engineering teams seldom deliver a complete product. In most cases, they deliver slivers of functionality that compose into a larger whole. A PO, therefore, does not "own" the product in its entirety. At best, they "share" the product, each familiar with and responsible for their part. Their lack of complete context is fraught with risk and invites disorder.
>
>It is perhaps more fitting to call them Product Co-Owners.
>
>Secondly, having a team of Product Co-Owners in charge of delivery muddles accountability for the final product. The final product may not be ideally fit for purpose without negligence on any particular individual's part.

# Engineer
Engineers apply engineering principles to build software solutions, fulfilling capability delivery. Engineers —

+ Collaborate with PEs and POs in designing product capabilities and problem-solving in general.
+ Write, test, document, and maintain software components.
+ Ensure that requirements — functional and nonfunctional — are met at the component level.
+ Assist PEs in work breakdown and estimation activities.
+ Protect business assets by securing intellectual property and sensitive data.
+ Engage in business-as-usual (BAU) activities outside capability delivery.
+ Offer advice and coaching to more junior colleagues.
+ Share knowledge and experiences, ensuring that the continuity of knowledge exists within the team.
+ Assist in the hiring and onboarding of colleagues.
+ Partake in continuous improvement initiatives, as defined by their managers and department heads.

**Accountable for**:

- The completeness, quality and timeliness of software deliverables.
- Open and honest communication with teammates, including giving and accepting constructive feedback, and respecting others' opinions.

It was stated earlier that Principal Engineers have the most important and wide-ranging role in the CONTROL delivery organisation. It must be recognised that PEs were not trained specifically for their role; they started as rank engineers, perhaps even within the same delivery organisation. 

For the Engineer role, you are looking at a prospective future Principal or perhaps an Engineering Manager, depending on whether they'll maintain specialisation in technology or pursue the management ladder<sup>2</sup>. (According to a 2019 IEEE-USA survey, the chances are they'll remain in tech.) Starting from a junior level, and at every point in their progression, they must learn to accept personal accountability and understand how their contributions tie into the delivery organisation. In CONTROL, it is not only the managers that are accountable but everyone in the delivery organisation.

><sup>2 </sup>According to a 2019 IEEE-USA survey, 56% of engineers will pursue tech-focused roles.

# System Tester
System Testers act in consideration of the business requirements, ensuring that the system as a whole fulfils expectations. System Testers —

+ Ensure that requirements are met at the overarching (end-to-end) system level.
+ Engage with Architects and Produce Owners for the planning of testing activities.

**Accountable for**:

- Test design, documentation, and execution.
- Coverage of critical capabilities.
- Measurement and communication of the outcomes of functional and nonfunctional testing.
- Open and honest communication with teammates, including giving and accepting constructive feedback, and respecting others' opinions.

Although CONTROL does not mandate the presence of testers in engineering teams, System Testers are required for systems that are maintained by two or more engineering teams. While engineering teams own a distinct subset of a system's components, no team is accountable for the complete system in an integrated delivery model. System Testers, therefore, act on behalf of the customer by verifying the system, ensuring that all critical capabilities are exercised end-to-end and in conditions that the system is expected to face. This includes simulated user load and the presence of failures. Acting as a pseudo-proxy for the recipient, they can accept delivery, reject the system, or stipulate limitations on its use.

System testing is entirely black-box for the following reasons:

* **Implementation agnostic**: Testing at the system level should not require knowledge of the internal code, making the test stimulus and assertions stable relative to changes to the underlying components, provided the contracts between the system and its environment have been upheld. This is particularly important when the testers do not work alongside the engineers, but are expected to devise and maintain system tests independently.
* **Unbiased**: Testers approach the system without preconceived notions about the internal implementation, leading to more objective and unbiased reasoning. This helps in identifying discrepancies between the actual and expected behaviour.
* **Avoids duplication**: Engineers produce tests during the Construction phase and throughout the system's maintenance, which will typically follow the white-box approach. By clearly differentiating test scopes, the two testing methods avoid overlapping efforts and are mutually complementary.

You may wonder why CONTROL is concerned with the particulars of system testing. It all boils down to accountability: the System Testing community —

* Must be allowed to perform their duties effectively without reliance on other teams or individuals; and
* Mustn't be influenced by decisions stemming from engineering teams; otherwise, they cannot objectively represent the interests of the business.

CONTROL's guidance aligns with that of other industry bodies. The ISTQB (International Software Testing Qualifications Board, 2018) Syllabus and the IEEE Standard for Software and System Test Documentation (IEEE 829, 2008) clearly encourage black-box methods for system-level testing and verification of end-to-end functionality. Even when the system is delivered by one engineering team, CONTROL recommends independent system testing for the impartiality accorded by an independent verification authority.

System testing is distinct from User Acceptance Testing (UAT). Although system testers act as a pseudo-proxy, they are _employed by the delivery organisation_ as a quality control measure. Their main objective is ensuring that the delivery trajectory is towards a quality product. System testing doubles as a quality measurement and feedback loop, informing management of whether the quality objectives are being met and creating opportunities for early course correction and stakeholder awareness. UAT, on the other hand, is the direct responsibility of the receiving party. Although quality is everyone's responsibility, the business stakeholders are ultimately accountable for ensuring that the delivered capabilities meet the needs of the business. As UAT activities fall outside the engineering delivery scope, CONTROL does not stipulate UAT roles and processes.

# System Testing Manager
System Testing Managers (STMs) look after the long-term interests of their team and the intellectual assets within their remit. STMs —

+ Ensure team cohesion and handle personnel matters.
+ Ensure adequate skills exist and evolve suitably over time.
+ Are responsible for hiring and performance management.
+ Are responsible for intellectual assets within their team's remit:
  - Documented test cases<sup>3</sup>; and
  - Automated tests.
+ Advise on testing principles, patterns and guidelines.
+ Derive performance criteria and methods of measurement based on nonfunctional requirements.
+ Design test cases and ensure their timely execution.
+ Track and manage technical debt and the Technical Roadmap<sup>4 </sup> scoped to the team.
+ Guarantee the continuity of knowledge and reduction of key personnel risks.

><sup>3 </sup>CONTROL does not impose on the particular choice of testing strategy or methods. For example, whether functional tests are manual or automated is more likely a consequence of priorities and resource constraints than free selection — given an unconstrained environment, the majority will choose to automate. The important consideration is the accountability and empowerment of STMs to make such decisions locally.

><sup>4 </sup>Testers have assets to maintain; therefore, Technical Roadmaps apply to them too.

**Accountable for**:

- Availability of suitably skilled individuals to fulfil testing objectives.
- Communicating resource gaps in a timely manner.
- A safe and suitable working environment for their reports.
- Ensuring the maintainability of test assets within their remit.
- Communicating gaps in the fitness (functionality, performance, reliability, etc.) of the system.


# Project Coordinator
A Project Coordinator is an optional role that assists PEs in ensuring that delivery proceeds according to plan and anomalies are quickly spotted and dealt with. Project Coordinators —

+ Facilitate estimation activities and document outcomes.
+ Compile and maintain schedules.
+ Track delivery progress.
+ Track resource utilisation.
+ Identify and communicate delivery anomalies.
+ Report the overall progress to stakeholders.
+ Chase blockers.
+ Act as a team scribe: minute meetings and take note of important decisions.
+ Follow up on actions.

**Accountable for**:

- Ensuring that delivery proceeds within planned parameters.
- Communicating delivery anomalies (e.g., lateness or resource overuse).

Project Coordinators needn't be committed to a delivery squad on a full-time basis. The level of commitment is largely at the discretion of the PE: they may need more or less assistance, depending on factors such as technical complexity and the PE's own level of commitment. (PEs may be involved in multiple capability deliveries.)

# Chalk outlines
## Individual skills in existing software development methods
The point that both Classical and Agile methodologies fail to recognise and promote individual skills may be met with resentment from their proponents. I suggest tempering your opinion until you have completed this passage.

Classical methodology focuses predominantly on planning and structure. Methods like Royce's "final" model, Boehm's Spiral, the IID family, and the Unified Process (and its numerous variants) are process-orientated. The latter notably emphasises modelling. They are designed for repeatability and predictability.

It is understandable that they should be prescriptive in the ways that they are; they are referred to as "plan-driven" for that reason. They are intended for use with organisations of varying sizes, a diverse mixture of skills and experience, and software projects of varying complexity. An emphasis on repeatability and planning is what makes them work, within reason. Or not, depending on the context.

Agile methodology is a lot less prescriptive in general. Some essential processes and tasks are prescribed, but on the large, it assumes that adoptees will draw the necessary inferences from its foundational principles and values. The "individuals and interactions over processes and tools" is a particularly noteworthy value. It suggests that people are at the forefront of the methodology. In turn, this implies that individual skills must be important to Agile.

Agile, at its core, advocates for small, colocated teams of _highly skilled_ individuals, working in environments of high uncertainty. These assumptions cannot be overstated. The "ideal" Agile implementation is not a general-purpose software development model; it is a niche model. I have argued this extensively in Chapter 2. Ultimately, Agile teams cannot function well in the absence of skills. Even a small imbalance can throw the orchestra out of tune.

As important as skills may be to Agile, this is not the same as "recognising and promoting" skills. Agile makes an _assumption_ that skills exist and are maintained somehow. It does not stipulate the _how_.

Comparing the two:

* Classical methodology makes few assumptions of the skills of individual contributors and strong (although largely implicit) assumptions of managerial and coordination skills.
* Agile methodology makes strong assumptions of the skills of individual contributors. Emphasis on self-organisation, combined with small team size and colocation, eliminates reliance on managerial and coordination skills.

With respect to individual skills, Classical _overlooks_ and Agile _assumes_. Neither strives to build or nurture.

# Summary
Strong individual skills and objectivity are the foundation for effective teams. Agile methodologies frequently use sports analogies to overemphasise teamwork and neglect the importance of individual contributions. These fallacies have important implications for group accountability and performance management. CONTROL implements strategies that underscore personal accountability within groups, mitigating the negative impact of social loafing and diffusion of responsibility.

CONTROL defines a handful of roles, each carefully defined to minimise overlap and allow accountability to flow naturally. These are summarised below.

## Principal Engineer
Principal Engineers (PEs) are the most skilled on-the-tools individuals within the delivery organisation. They design and deliver high-quality software while coaching others around them. PEs ensure software is developed efficiently and meets stakeholder expectations, working with Architects, Product Owners, and Engineers. They are responsible for end-to-end delivery, negotiating expectations, and maintaining quality. PEs also manage complex technical scopes and mentor junior engineers, bringing a structured and professional problem-solving approach to the organisation.

## Architect
Architects provide strategic leadership within the technical domain, ensuring that the system architecture evolves in alignment with business needs. They collaborate with Product Owners and Principal Engineers to design and implement robust system architectures. Architects balance technical risk and ambition, aligning architectural decisions with current and prospective Engineering capabilities. They ensure conformance with organisational and regulatory constraints and drive long-term planning for Technical Roadmaps.

## Engineering Manager
Engineering Managers (EMs) focus on the long-term interests of their teams and the health of software components under their purview. They handle personnel matters, ensure skill development, manage hiring and performance, and oversee the maintainability and supportability of software. EMs advise on engineering principles and best practices, track technical debt, and facilitate continuous improvement initiatives. They are accountable for providing a safe and productive work environment, ensuring resource availability, and meeting quality objectives.

## Product Owner
Product Owners (POs) provide a mixture strategic and tactical leadership within the Product domain, ensuring that delivered products meet business needs. They specify functional and nonfunctional characteristics, collaborate with Architecture and Engineering teams. POs represent business interests, acting as conduits between the business and the delivery organisation. POs align product capabilities with organisational goals and regulatory constraints. They interface with stakeholders to ensure comprehensive representation and guide the evolution of the product based on industry trends and company vision.

## Engineer
Engineers apply engineering principles to build software solutions, collaborating with Principal Engineers, Architects, and Product Owners in design and problem-solving. They write, test, document, and maintain software components, ensuring requirements are met. Engineers assist in work breakdown and estimation, secure intellectual property, engage in BAU activities, and offer coaching to junior colleagues. They are accountable for the quality, completeness, and timeliness of deliverables and maintain open communication within the team.

# System Tester
System Testers ensure that the system meets business requirements at the overarching level, acting as proxies for customers to verify end-to-end functionality. They design, document, and execute tests, covering critical capabilities. Functional and nonfunctional characteristics are measured using black-box strategies to avoid implementation bias. System Testers communicate findings objectively, ensuring that the system fulfils expectations and identifying areas for improvement.

# System Testing Manager
System Testing Managers (STMs) oversee the long-term interests of their teams and intellectual assets within their remit. They manage personnel, ensure skill development, hire and perform evaluations, and maintain documented test cases and automated tests. STMs advise on testing principles, offer guidance on test case design and implementation, track technical debt, and guarantee knowledge continuity. They are accountable for the quality and completeness of testing efforts, ensuring that performance criteria are met and testing strategies are effectively implemented.
